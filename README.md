# Regulatory Radar

A small web service for a Regulatory Affairs team. It answers two questions:

- **What is happening in the regulatory world?** Short summaries of FDA and EU
  updates, plus live or saved data from [openFDA](https://open.fda.gov/) on
  510(k) clearances and device recalls.
- **What does it mean for OUR products?** A portfolio of six products of the
  fictional company *Acme MedTech*, ready to be matched against those updates.

It is intentionally small so you can read all of it in one sitting and extend
it during the course.

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11 or newer.** Check with `python --version` (on macOS/Linux you
  may need `python3 --version`). Download from <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
  if needed. On Windows, tick "Add python.exe to PATH" in the installer.
- **A terminal.** Terminal on macOS, any shell on Linux, PowerShell on Windows.
- **Git** (optional, only if you want to track your changes).

## 2. Set up a virtual environment

A virtual environment is a private folder with this project's Python packages,
so nothing you install here affects the rest of your computer.

Open a terminal **in the project folder** (the one containing this README), then:

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If PowerShell refuses to run the activation script, run this once and try again:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
```

You will know it worked when your prompt starts with `(.venv)`. Repeat the
`activate` step every time you open a new terminal.

## 3. Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Configure (optional)

Settings live in a file called `.env` in the project folder. If you do not
have one, copy the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # macOS / Linux
copy .env.example .env      # Windows
```

The default mode is `fixture`, which uses sample openFDA data saved in
`data/fixtures` and works without internet access. Switch to `live` to query
api.fda.gov for real.

## 5. Run the server

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Leave this running. `--reload` restarts the server automatically whenever you
edit a file. Stop it with `Ctrl+C`.

## 6. Try it

**In your browser**

- <http://127.0.0.1:8000/health>
- <http://127.0.0.1:8000/products>
- <http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/heartlink-app>
- <http://127.0.0.1:8000/updates?jurisdiction=EU&tag=ai>
- <http://127.0.0.1:8000/clearances?query=pacemaker>
- <http://127.0.0.1:8000/recalls?query=ablation&since=2023-01-01>

**Interactive docs (Swagger UI)**

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>. Every endpoint is listed with its
parameters. Click one, press **Try it out**, fill in values and press
**Execute** to see the request and the response.

**From the terminal with curl**

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/health"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/products"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/orbit-surgical"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/updates?jurisdiction=FDA&since=2025-01-01"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/clearances?query=ablation%20catheter&limit=5"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/recalls?query=defibrillator&since=2023-01-01&limit=5"
```

(On Windows PowerShell, `curl` is an alias for `Invoke-WebRequest`; use
`curl.exe` instead, or just use the browser.)

## 7. Endpoints

| Endpoint | What it returns |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | `{"status": "ok", "mode": "fixture"}` |
| `GET /products` | All products from `data/portfolio.yaml` |
| `GET /products/{id}` | One product, or 404 |
| `GET /updates?jurisdiction=&tag=&since=YYYY-MM-DD` | Regulatory updates from `data/updates/*.md`, newest first, filtered |
| `GET /clearances?query=&limit=10` | 510(k) clearances whose device name contains every word in `query` |
| `GET /recalls?query=&since=YYYY-MM-DD&limit=10` | Recalls whose product description contains every word in `query`, initiated on or after `since` |

## 8. Run the tests

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

The tests use local data and the saved fixtures only, so they pass without
internet access.

## 9. Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENFDA_MODE` | `fixture` | `fixture` reads `data/fixtures/*.json`; `live` calls api.fda.gov |
| `OPENFDA_API_KEY` | *(empty)* | Optional openFDA API key; raises the rate limit in live mode |
| `OPENFDA_BASE_URL` | `https://api.fda.gov` | Base URL for live mode |
| `OPENFDA_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `10` | How long to wait for openFDA before giving up |

Values are read from your shell environment first, then from `.env`.

Tip: in `live` mode, leave `OPENFDA_API_KEY` empty unless you have a real key.
openFDA answers `403` to a wrong key, and the service then reports that error.

## About the data

Acme MedTech and its products are fictional. The regulatory updates are
training summaries written in general terms; always verify against the linked
official source. openFDA is a public API from the U.S. FDA and its own
disclaimer applies: the data is not validated and must not be used to make
decisions about medical care. The saved fixtures are real responses captured
in September 2026, lightly trimmed to keep the files small.
